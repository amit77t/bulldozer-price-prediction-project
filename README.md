# Bulldozer Price Prediction Project

## 🏗️ Overview
This project aims to predict the sale price of bulldozers using historical auction data. The model leverages Machine Learning techniques to analyze factors like equipment age, usage, and market conditions.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used for this project comes from the **Blue Book for Bulldozers** competition on Kaggle. It contains information on bulldozers sold at auctions, including:
- 📅 Sale date
- 🏗️ Machine age
- ⚙️ Equipment type
- ⏳ Usage hours
- 💲 Sale price
- 🏭 Manufacturer details

📌 **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - Blue Book for Bulldozers](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers)

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **📥 Data Collection**: Load dataset from CSV files.
2. **🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Convert categorical variables to numerical features
   - Extract relevant date features (year, month, etc.)
3. **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize price trends over time
   - Analyze correlations between features
4. **🧠 Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract useful features from text and categorical data
   - Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding
5. **🤖 Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Train regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Use metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for evaluation
6. **🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Optimize model performance using Grid Search or Random Search
7. **🚀 Model Deployment (Optional)**:
   - Deploy as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI
   - Create a web interface using Streamlit

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **🐍 Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, XGBoost)
- **📓 Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
- **🌐 Flask/FastAPI** for deployment (optional)

## ⚙️ Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bulldozer-price-prediction.git
$ cd bulldozer-price-prediction
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and model training:
```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```
To deploy the model as an API:
```bash
$ python app.py
```

## 📈 Results
- The model achieves an **RMSE of X** on the test dataset.
- Feature importance analysis shows that **machine age and equipment type** are the most significant predictors.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Incorporate deep learning models for better accuracy.
- Deploy the model as a full-stack web application.
- Collect more real-world data for improved generalization.
